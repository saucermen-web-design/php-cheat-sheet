Integers

# Integers

* The `(int)`, `(integer)`, or `intval()` function are often used to convert a value to an integer.

## Here are some rules for integers:

* An integer must have at least one digit

* An integer must NOT have a decimal point

* An integer can be either positive or negative

* Integers can be specified in three formats: decimal (10-based), hexadecimal (16-based - prefixed with 0x) or octal (8-based - prefixed with 0)

## PHP has the following predefined constants for integers:

* PHP_INT_MAX - The largest integer supported

* PHP_INT_MIN - The smallest integer supported

* PHP_INT_SIZE -  The size of an integer in bytes

## PHP has the following functions to check if the type of a variable is integer:

* is_int()

* is_integer() - alias of is_int()

* is_long() - alias of is_int()
